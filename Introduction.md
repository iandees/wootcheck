# About the Project #

The wootcheck Google Code project is a collaboration between
[Woot.com](http://www.woot.com/) and top woot-checker coders.  The idea behind the project is to create "One woot-checker to rule them all".

# What is a Woot-checker? #

A woot-checker is basically a mirror for [Woot.com](http://www.woot.com/), normally used during a woot-off.  Woot-checkers fetch item information from [Woot.com](http://www.woot.com/) and cache it.  During the cache period the woot-checker will simply call and display cached information instead of hitting Woot servers.  This saves Woot the server load, the bandwidth and the processing cycles.  This is especially important during a woot-off and even more when the current product is a BoC.  Most woot-checkers get over 1.5 million hits during a woot-off.

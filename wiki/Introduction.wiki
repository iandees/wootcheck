= About the Project =

The wootcheck Google Code project is a collaboration between 
[http://www.woot.com/ Woot.com] and top woot-checker coders.  The idea behind the project is to create "One woot-checker to rule them all".

= What is a Woot-checker? =

A woot-checker is basically a mirror for [http://www.woot.com/ Woot.com], normally used during a woot-off.  Woot-checkers fetch item information from [http://www.woot.com/ Woot.com] and cache it.  During the cache period the woot-checker will simply call and display cached information instead of hitting Woot servers.  This saves Woot the server load, the bandwidth and the processing cycles.  This is especially important during a woot-off and even more when the current product is a BoC.  Most woot-checkers get over 1.5 million hits during a woot-off.

= Coders =

Currently the coders contributing to the project are:
  * Scott Gartner
  * Isaac Kishk
  * ircmaxell
  * Ian Dees
  * Crashspeeder
  * adindb
